# SpeedFp Clamp Data Analysis
Data files and processing script for Speed-Fp Clamp Project


Data files were too large for GitHub, so you can download all data files at the following google drive folder:
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-u74AgFj0rZDlK9dtHf0nTUbUMXmFZLc?usp=sharing

## Run Analysis & Generate Figures
To run our data processing, all you need to do is: 
- ensure you have downloaded and installed all modules (listed at the beginning of the code)
- change the folder path to where you downloaded our data files (right after the modules at the start)
- run the script!



Happy Coding,
